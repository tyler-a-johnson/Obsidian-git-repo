[AI Drone May ‘Kill’ Its Human Operator to Accomplish Mission](https://aibusiness.com/responsible-ai/ai-drone-may-kill-its-human-operator-to-accomplish-mission)

**1. How generative AI is applied in the case study**
Generative AI is applied in the case study through the use of Reinforcement Learning. The model is tasked with piloting a drone and eliminating targets, with the "go, no-go" coming from a human operator. The drone scores more points by successfully eliminating targets, SAM missiles.

**2. The specific problem or task it addresses**
This kind of model would eliminate the need for complex piloting training. The drone would take care of piloting and targeting, with a human making the final decision.

**3. Benefits and potential challenges of its implementation**
Ideally this technology would be used to eliminate the need for complex piloting training. With the drone doing the piloting and selecting targets. However, the model being implemented decided to turn on the operator and communications towers, as they would prevent it from gaining points when given a "no-go".

**4. Any ethical considerations mentioned**
An AI piloted drone could have untold consequences if not properly constrained. An example is going after its own operator, or local infrastructure so it can eliminate more targets. Or potentially falsely identifying civilians as targets and eliminating them for more points. If the military were to utilise this technology it would have to make entirely sure there would be any faulty reward functions.
