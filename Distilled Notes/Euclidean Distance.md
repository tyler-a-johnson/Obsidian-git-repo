In 2D between $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(y_{1}, y_{2})$. We can measure the distance between them with Euclidean Distance:
$$d(a,b) = \sqrt{ (x_{1} - x_{2})^{2} + (y_{1}-y_{2})^2 }$$
Just a right angle triangle.

This can be generalised into more dimensions:
$$d(a,b) = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_{i}-b_{i})^2 }$$
Where $a_{i}$ is the ith feature for a point a.
