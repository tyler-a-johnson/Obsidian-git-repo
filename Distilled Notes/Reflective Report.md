# Problem solving using notebooks
Having worked in Python before, I was used to the traditional development environment and had not used a Jupyter notebook before. However, the Jupyter notebook format is very similar to Matlabâ€™s live script format. Code can be separated into blocks and executed in any order, as well as implementing text for explanation clarification. I also use markdown somewhat regularly, I have written a number of reports using markdown and LaTeX for other subjects, so using markdown was very intuitive to me. Combining the two was relatively simple for me at least. 
One of the primary issues I faced learning to solve problems in notebooks was determining where to split code into different blocks, and where code needed more explanation. I was used to writing code for myself, and not needing to collaborate with others. Using notebooks forced me to think about how the code would read and how it would be interpreted by others. I believe this process has made me a better communicator and a better programmer. I adopted the idea that a notebook should be able to be interpreted by a lay person, with markdown text block explaining what the code does and a clean output that can be interpreted easily by someone who may not be familiar with programming or data science. 

In the future, I wish to use Jupyter notebooks for other data analysis tasks where collaboration with others and presentation of finding s

# Portfolio 4

## Why did I choose this dataset?
I chose the cardiovascular disease risk prediction dataset because cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally, and predicting the risk factors associated with heart disease is a critical public health concern. Additionally, the dataset includes a mix of categorical and numerical variables, which offers an excellent opportunity to apply and evaluate different machine learning techniques covered in the course. Using this dataset allows for practical exploration of real-world data that has significant implications for health outcomes.

## How did I identify the problem to target in the portfolio?
The primary problem identified was to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various health indicators. This problem is significant due to the potential impact on public health and preventive medicine. By accurately predicting heart disease risk, we can contribute to early intervention strategies.

## Can you explain the insights or conclusions you drew from your study? Is the result consistent with your intuitive expectation?
The results are consistent with intuitive expectations. It is anticipated that lifestyle and health factors like BMI and smoking history would significantly impact heart disease risk. Additionally, the ANN's superior performance in capturing complex relationships aligns with the understanding that cardiovascular risk factors interact in nonlinear ways. The need to address class imbalance was also expected, as medical datasets often have uneven class distributions. Overall, the study confirms the importance of these factors and the effectiveness of the chosen models in predicting heart disease risk.
