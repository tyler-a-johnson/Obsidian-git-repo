title: A.M Turing (1950)
I propose to consider the question: "Can machines think?"

```

In 1950, British mathematician and logician Alan Turing introduced the concept now known as the Turing Test in his seminal paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". Turing sought to address the question, "Can machines think?" To sidestep the complexities of defining "thinking," he proposed an operational test based on a party game called the "Imitation Game". 

In this game, a human interrogator communicates with two unseen participants—a human and a machine—through written messages. The interrogator's task is to determine which respondent is human. If the machine's responses are indistinguishable from those of the human, it is said to have demonstrated human-like intelligence.
