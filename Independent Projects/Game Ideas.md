- FPS Game with rich enemy comms tied to gameplay
	- Kill enemies to have access to their comms for a short period before their security key times out (take their earpieces - enemy control notices after a short period and cuts the piece off)
	- Useful but not integral information through comms - ingame voice chat?
	- Is this not just cavs interrogate feature from r6?
	- Would need a way to force players to use ingame voice chat

- **BIG FUCKER** - Long term - Probably not viable solo
	- Warframe + Titanfall (Closer to titanfall)
	- Wallrunning and parkour is a major focus
	- Asymmetrical multiplayer between 'mechs' and pilots 
		- Is it competitive FPS or more MMO like Warframe?
		- Balancing would be fucked
		- How fast are the mechs compared to pilots? Would need to be much slower (Again, Titanfall/Necramechs)
	- Anthem had a lot of potential, but fucked it up with a shit story, mid progression and build variety and being published by EA
		- More grounded mech piloting as opposed to transference
		- Similar aesthetic, grungy industrial sci fi
		- last of humanity type vibe
	- Maybe a 'tandem' gameplay loop
		- Fight alongside your mech
		- Get inside the mech to perform more powerful maneuvers
		- Mech needs time to cool off - kicks you out
		- Cycle repeats
		- Would be much closer to warframe

- Bass Reeves [how does an indie game get made? - YouTube](https://youtu.be/69Ukg2BqIk0)
	- Criminal that the game died
	- Could be done with a combination of the wheel minigame and gameplay
		- Highlight the different aspects of Reeves' life with different gameplay loops
			- Wheel Game
			- Point and click
			- Homestead building
			- FPS/Railshooter/Other minigame
			- Already scope is out of hand lol
