# Business Rules
 Statements that define or constrain aspects of business.
	- Derived from policies, procedures, events and functions within the organisation.
	- They assert structure and control / influence behaviour, ensuring consistency and adherence to **organisational standards**.
	- Expressed in terms familiar to end users.

1. **Declarative**: It focuses on *what* needs to be done rather than *how*.
2. **Precise**: The rule is clear and has an agreed upon meaning.
3. **Atomic**: The rule should be a single standalone statement that addresses a specific aspect of business.
4. **Consistent**: The rule is internally consistent within itself and does not conflict with other rules or policies
5. **Expressible**: Can be easily understood and expressed in natural language.
6. **Distinct**: Non-redundant, avoiding duplication or overlap with other rules.
7. **Business oriented**: Written in a manner that can be easily understood by businesspeople and stakeholders.
