# Database Application Development

**Database Applications:** Software to facilitate data collection, storage, management, and retrieval.
- *Data collection:* Gathering data from other sources, such as user input, sensor data, etc.
- *Data storage:* processing data into necessary structure for storage
- *Data managment:* More sophisticated authorisation and security features.
- *Data retrieval:* Providing a user friendly interface.


# Database in Client-Server Architecture Models
In a networked system environment, databases are part of the client-server architecture, which could be multi-tier, where the tasks are distributed amongst the components involved within the system environment.
Terminologies:  
- **Client**: requests and uses a service
- **Server**: provides a service  
    Note: a server would act as a client when requesting service from another server.
- **Front-end functions**: functions to interact with the end-users
- **Back-end functions**: functions to interact with the servers
