# Associative Entities (ERD's)

**Type1: Attributes on a relationship**
Associative entities help in resolving complex many-to-many relationships by introducing a new entity that holds additional attributes related to the relationship. This is represented in the many-many relationship as a rectangle with attributes linked using a dotted line. Please refer to the lecture recording for more examples.  

**Type2: Ternary relationship**  
A ternary relationship represents a relationship between three/more entities. It occurs when there is a complex association involving three/more entities, and it cannot be represented by a combination of binary relationships. So, where the relationships of the three entities meet, there will be an entity, and that's an associative entity.Â   

NO PIs for the Associative entities, please! If you add an PI, it becomes a strong entity.
