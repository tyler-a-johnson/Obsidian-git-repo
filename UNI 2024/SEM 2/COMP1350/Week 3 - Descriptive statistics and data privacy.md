*Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)* is a standardised workflow for Data Mining/Data Science that attempts to lay out a methodology to follow in a project. It is in comparable to software development life cycle. 

- As a **methodology**, CRISP-DM includes descriptions of the typical phases of a project, the tasks involved with each phase, and an explanation of the relationships between these tasks.
- As a **process model**, CRISP-DM provides an overview of the data mining life cycle.

## CRISP-DM model is flexible and can be customised
- Example 1: **Detecting money laundering**
  This task mainly focus on data exploration and visualisation to uncover suspicious patterns in data
- Example 2: [AI-based animal recognition](https://siwalusoftware.com/)
