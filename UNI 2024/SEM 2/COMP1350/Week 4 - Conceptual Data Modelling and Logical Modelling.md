# #Relation/Table
- A relation denotes a titled, two-dimensional data table.
- A table is comprised of rows (records) and columns (attributes or fields)

**Necessities for a table to meet the criteria of being a relation:**
- *Must* possesses a distinct name
- Each attribute value *must be indivisible* (not multi-valued or composite)
- Every row must be distinct (*cannot contain two identical rows with all fields having the same values*)
- Attributes (*columns*) within tables *must hold* unique designations.
- *Sequence of columns must not matter*
- *Sequence of rows must not matter*

**Connection to the ER Model**
- *Relations* (tables) correspond to *entities*
- *Rows* correspond to *values*
- *Columns* correspond to *attributes*.
