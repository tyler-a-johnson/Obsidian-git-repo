# SQL
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized language originally designed as a relational database query tool.
Currently used in many software products to retrieve and update data â€“ E.g., MySQL, SQL Developer, Snowflake.

## Data Types
- The data type of a column defines the value a column can hold
- Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.
- The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column
- SQL developer (YOU) must decide Data Type

| DataType           | Example      | Display    |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| INT                | INT          | 12345678   |
| DECIMAL(size, dec) | DECIMAL(8,2) | 123456.22  |
| CHAR(size)         | CHAR(8)      | ALAVI      |
| VARCHAR            | VARCHAR(8)   | ALAVI      |
| DATE (YYYY-MM-DD)  | DATE         | 2022-08-27 |

# SQL Servers: ASH vs Local
|                    | Ash Server                                                                                                                                  | Local                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Connecting         | Server is already set up. Follow guides for connecting.                                                                                     | Must be installed onto device. Follow guides for installation.                                      |
| Can create schema? | No. Each connection to the ash server is only allowed 1 schema. The schema will be named as your **studentID**.                             | Can create as many schemas. Need to use 'create schema **_schemaName_**' and 'use **_schemaName_**' |
| Case sensitive?    | Yes **table** names are case sensitive. Be very careful during Create Table phase.  <br>  <br>Column names and data are not case sensitive. | Not case sensitive.                                                                                 |
| Reliable?          | For the most part, yes. But can become problematic nearing assignment submission dates when many students are connected.                    | No down time.                                                                                       |
