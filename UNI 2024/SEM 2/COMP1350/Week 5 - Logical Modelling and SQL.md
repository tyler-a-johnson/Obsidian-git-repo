# SQL
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized language originally designed as a relational database query tool.
Currently used in many software products to retrieve and update data â€“ E.g., MySQL, SQL Developer, Snowflake.

## Data Types
- The data type of a column defines the value a column can hold
- Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.
- The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column
- SQL developer (YOU) must decide Data Type

| DataType           | Example      | Display    |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| INT                | INT          | 12345678   |
| DECIMAL(size, dec) | DECIMAL(8,2) | 123456.22  |
| CHAR(size)         | CHAR(8)      | ALAVI      |
| VARCHAR            | VARCHAR(8)   | ALAVI      |
| DATE (YYYY-MM-DD)  | DATE         | 2022-08-27 |
