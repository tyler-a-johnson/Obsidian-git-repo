In this critical analysis Assignment, you are required to perform the following tasks to improve the quality of the Jupyter notebook, based on the knowledge and skills you have learned from this unit (covering both the first and the second halves).

- Task-1: You need to identify at least 4 critical issues in the Python source code that implements the data analysis project. A critical issue refers to a technical issue in the Python source code that results in the failure of the source code to achieve the specified aim. While the problematic code can still be runnable and produces some results, the inconsistency between the source code and the specified aims is critical and can cause severe consequences including poor prediction performances, unimplemented specified requirements, etc. For example, if a data analysis project aims to use a linear regression model to perform linear regression, using a logistic regression model in the source code implementation will be regarded as a critical issue.
- Task-2: You need to explain and justify why the identified technical issues are critical.
- Task-3: Your need to correct the identified critical issues with providing the rationale, performing the changes in the source code, and reporting the changes observed in the code execution results. You could directly replacing the error snippets with your own code.

Notes:  

- As the dataset for the notebook is a real-world dataset, the performance of the model are not that satisfied as the selected model might not be sufficient to capture the inner relationship of the data. But your main focus is NOT to improve the model accuracy . Instead, as described above, your task is to identify the misalignment between the specified aim in the description in each step and the code implementation, or the misalignment between the code execution results and the written analysis.  
    
- You do **NOT** need to talk about problems irrelevant to data science concepts and techniques such as the markdown format, grammar mistakes, or typos in your report.  
    
- You do **NOT** need to consider which model is better for solving the problem or what insights can be obtained from the data analysis project.
