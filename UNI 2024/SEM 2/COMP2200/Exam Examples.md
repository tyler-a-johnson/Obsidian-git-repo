Assume that you have been provided with the Iris dataset having 150 data instances in total. The dataset has 3 classes namely Setosa, Virginica, and Versicolor. Each class has 50 samples in the data, providing an equal distribution. You split the data into training data and testing data with the 70:30 ratio. Explain why it is important to use “Stratified Sampling” while splitting the data. (Write no more than 200 words in total)

One of the most common approaches to validate the performance of a model is to split a dataset into training and testing sets. This single holdout sample method is useful when your have a large dataset that can be partitioned. When we have smaller datasets, K-Fold CrossValidation is the preferred approach. Explain why K-Fold is preferred in such a case, and how it overcomes the disadvantages of the single holdout approach. (Write no more than 200 words in total)


Please use Fermi Estimation to estimate how much toilet paper do we use every year in Australia? You may need to make necessary assumptions first, and then make an estimation based on these assumptions.
