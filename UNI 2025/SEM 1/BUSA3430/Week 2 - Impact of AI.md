# EU AI Act (June 2023)
Title II (Article 5) of the proposed AI act explicitly **bans harmful practices** that are considered to be a clear threat to people's safety.
- AI systems that deploy harmful manipulative 'subliminal techniques'
- AI systems that exploit specific vulnerable groups (physical or mental disability)
- AI systems used by public authorities, or on their behalf, for social scoring purposes.
- 'real time' remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes, except in a limited number of cases.

Title III (Article 6) of the proposed AI act regulates 'high-risk' AI systems that create adverse impact on people's safety or their fundamental rights. The draft text distinguishes between two categories of high-risk AI systems.
- Systems used as a safety component of a product or falling under EU health and safety harmonization legislation.
- Systems deployed in **eight specific areas** identified in Annex III, which the commission could update as necessary through delegated acts (Article 7):
	- Biometric identification and categorization of natural persons.
	- Management and operation of critical infrastructure
	- Education and vocation training
	- Employment worker management and access to self-employment
	- Access to and enjoyment of essential private services and public services and benefits.
	- Law enforcement
	- Migration asylum and border control management
	- Administration of justice and democratic processes.

## PACE Layering

![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307230633.png)

**Fashion:** 
- The application layer consists of specific AI applications and use cases deployed within businesses and industries.
- This layer often experiences rapid innovation and iteration as organizations develop and deploy AI solutions to address various business challenges.
- Examples include chatbots for customer service, recommendation systems for e-commerce, and predictive analytics for demand forecasting.

**Commerce:** 
- In the original framework, the Commerce Layer refers to the layer focused on transactions, markets, and business models. 
- This layer deals with how goods and services are exchanged and how economic activities are conducted.
- Changes in this layer could be caused by AI disruptions resulting in business models becoming obsolete, professions changed or becoming obsolete;

**Infrastructure Layer:**
- This layer represents the foundational elements of AI, including hardware infrastructure, cloud computing, networking technologies, and other type of infrastructure.
- Changes in this layer tend to be slow-moving but have profound implications for AI development. 
- For example, advancements in hardware technology, such as GPUs and TPUs, enable faster processing speeds and support more complex AI models.

**Governance Layer:**
- The governance layer involves policies, regulations, and ethical considerations surrounding the development and deployment of AI.
- Changes in this layer may encompass efforts to address concerns related to bias, misinformation, privacy, and security in AI language models. This may include the development of guidelines, standards, and best practices for responsible AI development and deployment.

**Culture:**
- Long-standing societal attitudes, norms, and ethical considerations surrounding human-computer interaction and AI.
- Changes in this layer may involve shifts in public perception, ethical frameworks, and cultural expectations regarding the use of AI in communication and decision- making processes.

**Nature Layer:**
- The Nature Layer typically refers to environmental and ecological factors that shape the broader context in which a system operates.
- Changes in this layer may include shifts in societal preferences and understanding of the environmental impact; even nature itself can create a shift in this layer
