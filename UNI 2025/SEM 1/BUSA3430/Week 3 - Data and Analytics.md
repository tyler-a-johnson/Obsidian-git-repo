# Definitions

- **(Raw) Data:**  Raw, unprocessed symbols, numbers, or signals recorded from observations, measurements, or transactions. They are the basic, objective elements that capture aspects of reality without any interpretation or organization.
- **Information:** Information is data that has been processed, organised, or structured in a way that makes it meaningful, valuable and useful.
- **Intelligence:** The capability of a system to process raw data, learn from patterns within that data, and make decisions or predictions in a manner that mimics certain aspects of human cognition.
- **Knowledge:** 

- **Cold Data:** Quantitative data stored, generated, and used, by operational systems
- **Warm Data:** Data shared and collected through human story telling - richer than qualitative.
- **Synthetic Data:** Artificial data designed to mimic real-world data. It's generated through statistical methods, or through other GenAI. Despite being artificial the data still retains the underlying statistical properties of the original data.

- **Datafication:** Use of AI resulting in individuals being 'datafied', and consequently labelled. Effectively using multiple data points to categorize a human (eg. labelled as 'credit risk individual').

- **Data Provenance:** 

## Data Structures

**Structured:** Structured data send to data that is organized and design in a specific way to make it easily readable and understand by both humans and machines.

**Semi-Structured Data:** Semi-structured data is a type of data that is not purely structured, but also not completely unstructured. It contains some level of organization or structure, but does not conform to a rigid schema or data model, and may contain elements that are not easily categorized or classified.

**Unstructured Data:**  **Unstructured data** refers to information that does not have a **predefined format** or **structure**, making it challenging to organize, process, and analyze. Unlike structured data, which is **organized** into tables and columns, unstructured data comes in various forms, such as **text documents**, **images**, **audio files**, videos, and social media posts. Due to its varied formats, unstructured data requires advanced techniques for storage, retrieval, and analysis

## Data Quality
- Accuracy - Does the data accurately represent reality?
- Integrity - Is the structure of the data and relationships among entities and attributes maintained consistently?
- Consistency - Are data elements consistently defined and understood?
- Completeness - is all necessary data present?
- Validity - Do data values fall withing acceptable range?
- Timeliness - Is data available when its needed?
- Accessibility - Is the data easily accessible, understandable and usable?

**Syntactic Data Quality:** Can be managed by technology (eg. different date formats, truncated data, leading spaces)
**Semantic Data Quality:** Issues with meaningless data or data that is misidentified. (eg. incorrect values, duplicate values, conflicting info)
**Pragmatic Data Quality:** Deals with usage of data in context and for a particular purpose (eg. irrelevant data used to train, missing important data, unusable data, overly granular data)

# Big Data

Defining Characteristics:
- ***VOLUME:*** The amount of data being generated and processed.
- ***VELOCITY:*** The rate at which data is generated and/or processed.
- ***VARIETY:*** The diversity of different forms of data being collected.

Small data also exist, but not as common of a phrase. Refers to organisational data.

# NSW Gov - AI Assurance Framework

```ad-quote
From March 2022, the AI Assurance Framework wil be required for all projects which contain an AI component of utilise AI-driven tools. This includes the use of LLMs and GenAI which are explicitly within the scope of the application of the Assurance Framework. However a project is not expected to use the framework if:
- It uses an AI system that is a widely available commercial application, and
- The solution is not being customised in any way or being used other than intended.
```

# Business Analytics

- A broad category of applications, tech, and processes for gathering, storing, accessing, and analyzing data.
- Extended to include relational organisational practices such as data governance, data quality methodologies, analytical capabilities, decision environments.

## Types of Decisions

## Data Analytics
- No universal definition
-  One definition: "The process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modelling data for business decision making"
- "Low level data science"

# AI and BA

- AI is developed to mimic the human ability to learn and make decisions
- BA is developed to support decision makers at different organisational levels

- AI and BA are increasingly combined and often referred to as "AI-driven BA"
- Davenport (2018) uses the term Analytical and non-Analytical AI
