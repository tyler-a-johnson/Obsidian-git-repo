![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250317113054.png)
 
- Strategic management tool
- Business design and analysis tool

The BMC enables people and businesses to design, visualise, analyse, innovate, and communicate their business models effectively to different audiences.

## Benefits
- **Concise overview** - One page snapshot
- **Collaboration** - Facilitates team alignment and understanding
- **Iterative Design** - Allows testing and refining business models
- **Simple** - Easy to learn and apply


## Limitations
- Strategy is not explicitly considered
- Environment is not considered
- Business Model is a snapshot in time - must be manually updated
- BMC is a framework, rather than a prescriptive model.

## Example: Spotify
